## SnowPlow Simple App
This is an example shopping app I built to try and implement an analytics tracker. I used a Google Analytics tracker to display tracking on purchased items by importing the @analytics/google-analytics npm package, and set up a simple tracker to display which item has been purchased. 

In order to see this in action, I would recommend copying the repo onto your machine and running it on your local environment with npm run start.
